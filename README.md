# PIC16F887-Familiarization
Quick project to learn analog and digital I/O on the PIC16F887 microcontroller

---

I picked up a PICkit 2 for free the other day, and wanted to figure out how to use it. After some fiddling, I managed to successfully incorporate a digital input, a built-in analog-to-digital converter, and an output, all in one program. Interfacing directly with registers was a new experience for me, but I'm getting the hang of it.
