# PIC16F887-Familiarization
Quick project to learn analog and digital I/O on the PIC16F887 microcontroller

This program displays the truncated big endian 8-bit value of the potentiometer when the button is pushed. Schematics [here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001296C.pdf).

I picked up a PICkit 2 for free the other day, and wanted to figure out how to use it. After some fiddling, I managed to successfully incorporate a digital input, a built-in analog-to-digital converter, and an output, all in one program. Interfacing directly with registers was a new experience for me, but I'm getting the hang of it.
